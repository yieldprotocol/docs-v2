# Solidity API

## ERC1155

Minimalist and gas efficient standard ERC1155 implementation.

### TransferSingle

```solidity
event TransferSingle(address operator, address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount)
```

### TransferBatch

```solidity
event TransferBatch(address operator, address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts)
```

### ApprovalForAll

```solidity
event ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)
```

### URI

```solidity
event URI(string value, uint256 id)
```

### balanceOf

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) balanceOf
```

### isApprovedForAll

```solidity
mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) isApprovedForAll
```

### uri

```solidity
function uri(uint256 id) public view virtual returns (string)
```

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public virtual
```

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data) public virtual
```

### safeBatchTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data) public virtual
```

### balanceOfBatch

```solidity
function balanceOfBatch(address[] owners, uint256[] ids) public view virtual returns (uint256[] balances)
```

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public pure virtual returns (bool)
```

### _mint

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data) internal
```

### _batchMint

```solidity
function _batchMint(address to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data) internal
```

### _batchBurn

```solidity
function _batchBurn(address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts) internal
```

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal
```

## ERC1155TokenReceiver

A generic interface for a contract which properly accepts ERC1155 tokens.

### onERC1155Received

```solidity
function onERC1155Received(address operator, address from, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes data) external returns (bytes4)
```

### onERC1155BatchReceived

```solidity
function onERC1155BatchReceived(address operator, address from, uint256[] ids, uint256[] amounts, bytes data) external returns (bytes4)
```
